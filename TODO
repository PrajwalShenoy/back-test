# BUG FIXES
Fixed the commands present in examples.py (trade1.run() was replaced with trade1.runBackTest())
Fixed the issues with "backtest execution date"
Fixed the issue with the "first date"/"start_date" being present in all reports (This was causing problems in consolidated reports)
Consolidated reports are now sorted by default. Previously the date order was jumbled
Added historical_data_script, made additions to examples.py as well.
